Spectrum caps were set as follows: an overall cap as 25% of spectrum in each region (including all bands that are used in India), a 50% cap for 1800MHz spectrum in each region and a 50% cap for 900MHz spectrum in each region.  The caps include existing holdings.  Detailed coverage obligations were set out, with several phases of increasing levels of coverage.  390 lots were unsold, across various 1800MHz categories.


Annual fees are to be calculated as the maximum between 5% of the winning bid amount and x% of Adjusted gross revenue where x is: 3% for upto 4.4MHz; 4% for upto 6.2MHz; 5% for up to 8.2MHz; 6% for up to 10.2MHz; 7% for up to 12.2MHz; 8% for up to 15.2MHz (exisiting holdings in the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands are taken into account).   As the Adjusted gross revenue is unknown 5% of the winning bid amount/reserve price has been used to calculate the licence fee/minimum price.
