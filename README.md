# Spectrum-Data-Challenge
We were given a database containing data from DotEconâ€™s Spectrum Award Database, on various spectrum allocations done worldwide from 1994 until 2020. For Australia's 3G and India's 3G spectrum data, we analyzed all the features, figured out the important features of a spectrum, and then visualized these features. After analyzing and visualizing these features by relating them, we tried to predict prices for the next year in case of India 3G Spectrum.
